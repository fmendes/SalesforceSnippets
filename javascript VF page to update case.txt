//Just in case someone else needs it, here is the code for a VisualForce page with no Apex controller - it uses Javascript only to update the record when viewed by the owner.
//
//The page needs to be embedded in all page layouts for Case so that when the user opens the case detail page, it will execute this javascript update.
//It will not do anything if the user just opens the Case FEED.
//
//The page will check whether the case owner id is the same as the user id and if they're different it will stop without doing anything to the case.
//
//If the update fails, it will not warn the user but will only log the error in the browser's developer console.
